HOW TO RUN:
	After opening the python file in the terminal/the command prompt, it will show the main menu having 4 choices(from A-D). 
	Choosing A will let you play the 1st board with the size of 7x6. It needs 4 pieces to win.  
	Choosing B will let the players play the 2nd board with the size of 8x7. It needs 5 pieces to win.
	It can be played by entering the column number where u want to put your pieces. There are 2 players. 
	The first player who can complete the needed number of pieces to win (depends on the size of the board)
	either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the board will be considered the winner for the game.
	If the players already completed the board without any declared winners, it will be considered game over.
	Choosing C will let the players load the previous game. If it still has no winner or still not game over, 
	they can continue playing it. But if the previous game already has a winner, the program will ask the players 
	to choose whether to go back to the main menu and play another game or exit the game immediately.
	The players can end/exit the game from the main menu from choosing D.
	The players can go back to the main menu by entering "0" while still playing.
